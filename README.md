<h1>Decoding Hex</h1>
<h3>Use the Excel spreadsheet to decode the hex transmission</h3>

This is an example of a transmitted message:

    S000C042900CA7R0T13112D
    
Once separated into the three sections, with the help of the header code it looks like this:

    S000C042900CA7
    R0
    T13112D

Once separated into the different integer representations it looks like this:

    S 000C  0429  00CA  7
    R 0
    T 131  12D

With the Excel spreadsheet you can enter the three sections separatly to decode them and receive the message in plain English.
